# Business Analytics Student Survey

## a. Project Description

This project is a two-page web form that collects information from Business Analytics students. It asks about students' background and what BAIS classes they’ve taken.

## b. Web Form Best Practices

I used good web form practices to make the form clear and easy to use. Each form input has a label that tells users exactly what to enter. I used dropdowns and radio buttons to limit typing and reduce errors. The form is split into two pages so it's not too overwhelming, and there’s a page count so users know where they are.

I also added a tooltip icon to help explain the “home town” question without adding too much text on the page. Required fields are clearly marked with “(Required field)” so users know what they need to fill out before continuing.

## c. Accessibility Features

To make my form accessible, I used fieldsets and legends to group related questions, which helps screen readers. I made sure the red text for required fields has enough contrast to meet accessibility standards. I also added a small JavaScript function to make sure users check at least one box for BAIS classes, since HTML doesn’t do that on its own.

Overall, I tried to make the form easy to understand and usable for everyone.
